## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.


The top asked algorithms in Interviews are:
1. Graph
2. Linked List
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Sorting And Searching
5. Tree / Binary Search Tree
6. Number Theory
7. BIT Manipulation
8. String / Array
